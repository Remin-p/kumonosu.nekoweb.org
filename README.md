The reader has stumbled upon the repository for [my personal website](https://truss.nekoweb.org/)!

The reason for this repo is that Nekoweb has no guarantee that the user's data will be able to be fully recovered in case of data loss, so this repo can serve as a backup.

<sup>i also wanted to mess with Nekoweb's API. everything i made here is for fun, but it provided me some valuable lessons in programming (read: the git diff rant)!</sup>

I'll use this space as a roadmap for my website. *There is no guarantee that I will actually add what's here or that it will be named the same as it is here!!! This is just a personal list!!!!!*

Working now:

Priorities:

- Home page
- Loading screen
- Introduction
- Contact info (Guestbook)
- Music
- The git diff rant
- Update script (so it works with folders and removes files in the website that aren't in the repo)

Non-priority:

- How I made this website (really proud of this one)
- Pronouns (she/her)
